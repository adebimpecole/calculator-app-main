## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learnt about the Function() fuction and how to use it. I also learnt how to download fonts and apply them to my document.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: Spartan-Bold;
  src: url(images/spartan-bold.ttf);
}
```
```js
btn3.addEventListener("click", () => {
  let ans = Function("return " + ary)();
})
```


### Continued development

- The Function() function 
- Arrow functions
- Spread syntax
- Add and remove classes in JS

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 2](https://www.educative.io/edpresso/eval-vs-function-in-javascript) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand the difference between the eval() function and the Function() function and which one is better to use.
